## 💡 Overview

Tonelate is a **full-stack AI writing assistant** that helps users transform casual, slang, or shorthand text into clear and professional English in real time.  
It’s designed for anyone who wants to improve clarity and tone in online communication — from students to professionals to global teams.  

I built Tonelate with a strong emphasis on **usability, performance, and scalability**, handling both the user-facing interface and the backend logic that powers intelligent rewriting and language adaptation.
